# Product Context

## Why
- Knowledge workers and learners need effective tools to convert their notes into long-term memory
- Obsidian is excellent for note-taking, but lacks built-in spaced repetition functionality
- Anki is powerful for spaced repetition but has limited note-taking capabilities
- This plugin bridges the gap, allowing users to maintain their knowledge base in Obsidian while leveraging Anki's proven spaced repetition algorithms

## Problem Solved
- Eliminates the need to maintain separate systems for notes and flashcards
- Removes friction in the learning workflow by enabling in-place creation of flashcards
- Solves the problem of content duplication between note-taking and flashcard systems
- Addresses the challenge of keeping flashcards and source notes synchronized
- Enables context-rich learning by maintaining the connection between cards and source material

## How It Works
- Users write Markdown notes in Obsidian with special syntax for flashcard creation
- The plugin parses these notes to extract flashcard content
- Multiple card formats are supported (basic, cloze, reversed)
- Cards can be synchronized with Anki through AnkiConnect
- Changes in Obsidian are reflected in Anki during synchronization
- Plugin handles media files appropriately, transferring them to Anki when needed
- Provides a user interface for managing cards and sync status

## UX Goals
- Minimal disruption to the user's note-taking flow
- Intuitive syntax that fits naturally within Markdown documents
- Clear visual feedback on card creation and sync status
- Robust error handling with informative messages
- Flexibility in card formatting while maintaining simplicity
- Seamless integration with both Obsidian and Anki interfaces
- Support for different learning workflows (inline cards, dedicated card sections, or dedicated card files)
