# Progress

## What Works
- Repository is cleaned up, with unnecessary files removed
- Test coverage has been significantly improved
- Inline card parsing is functioning correctly
- Multi-line inline card parsing has been fixed
- Anki card ID format has been updated to use HTML comments
- Image rendering for wikilinks with dimensions works correctly
- System architecture has been comprehensively documented
- Technical context documentation is complete and detailed
- Parser class test coverage has been significantly improved with additional edge cases
- Content-based ID recovery for cards with missing IDs has been implemented
- CardsService ID recovery feature has test coverage for standard formats
- Content-based ID recovery correctly handles cases where Anki's duplicate detection is less strict than the plugin's full content matching (prevents duplicate creation errors)

## What's Left to Build
- Populate core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`)
- Further improve test coverage for other components of the plugin
- Fix ID recovery for triple-colon separator format (e.g., question:::answer)
- Verify ID recovery functionality in real-world usage with all card formats

## Current Status
- **ID Recovery Fix:** Resolved issue where cards without IDs were incorrectly marked for creation despite being duplicates according to Anki's first-field check.
  - Modified `filterByUpdate` to fetch all notes from the target Anki deck for comparison.
  - Implemented a two-step matching process:
    - Use a new `looselyMatchesFrontField` method (checking only the first field) to identify potential matches for ID recovery.
    - Use the existing strict `match` method (checking all fields and tags) *after* ID recovery to determine if the matched card needs an update.
  - This prevents the "cannot create note because it is a duplicate" error from AnkiConnect.
- **ID Recovery:** Implemented content-based ID matching to recover deleted IDs
  - Added automatic detection of cards missing IDs in Obsidian but present in Anki
  - Prevented duplicate card creation when IDs are manually deleted
  - Added robust handling for multiple potential matches with tracking of already matched cards
  - **Refined matching logic:** Now fetches all notes from the target deck and uses a two-step match (loose then strict) to align with Anki's duplicate detection while still checking for necessary updates.
- **Testing:** Test coverage further improved from 93.84% to 94.99%
  - Parser class coverage improved from 92.22% to 94.13%
  - Added extensive tests for error handling paths
  - Added tests for DOM-related operations with proper mocking
  - Added tests for HTML entity encoding in parser output
  - Added comprehensive tests for math notation, including complex formulas
  - Added detailed tests for image formats with various dimensions
  - Added specific tests for utility methods like `getEmbedMap` and `getEmbedWrapContent`
  - Improved test reliability with proper environment and mock management
- **Previous Testing:** Test coverage improved from 91.98% to 93.84%
  - Parser class coverage improved from 89.47% to 92.22%
  - Added comprehensive tests for complex parsing scenarios
  - Added tests for edge cases in Markdown formatting
  - Added tests for image and audio link processing
  - Added tests for cloze card handling with various formats
  - Added tests for embed content processing
  - Added tests for math notation conversion
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive architecture and technical documentation completed
  - Added detailed plugin architecture overview to `systemPatterns.md`
  - Enhanced `techContext.md` with detailed information on technologies, development setup, constraints, and dependencies
- **Initial Testing:** Test coverage improved from 81.47% to 91.98%
  - Entity classes coverage improved from 63.15% to 97.89%
  - Comprehensive tests added for all card types
  - Tests for image and audio processing added
  - Tests for context-aware mode with headings added
  - Tests for utility functions added
- **Fixes:**
  - Multi-line inline card parsing fixed
  - Anki card ID format updated to HTML comments
  - Image rendering for wikilinks with dimensions fixed

## Known Issues
- ID recovery does not work with triple-colon separator format (question:::answer), particularly with multi-line answers. This format is not properly recognized during the recovery process.
- Test coverage may not guarantee real-world functionality for all card formats and edge cases, as tests use mocked components that may behave differently than the actual application.

## Decision Evolution
- **ID Recovery Strategy:**
  - Implemented content-based matching to handle cases where users manually delete IDs in Obsidian
  - **Refinement:** To prevent duplicate errors from AnkiConnect, fetch all notes from the target deck. Use a two-step matching process:
    1.  `looselyMatchesFrontField`: Compare only the first field (e.g., 'Front') to find potential matches, aligning with Anki's likely duplicate detection. Recover ID if a loose match is found.
    2.  `match`: After loose match and ID recovery, perform a strict comparison of all fields and tags to determine if the recovered card needs to be *updated* in Anki.
  - Chose to automatically recover and insert IDs rather than requiring manual user intervention
- **CardsService Testing Strategy:**
  - Created dedicated test file for CardsService to test the ID recovery feature
  - Implemented mocking for Parser, Anki, and Regex services to isolate the code under test
  - Structured tests to cover the three main ID recovery scenarios (recovery, no change for existing IDs, no match)
  - Used direct method testing approach to focus specifically on the filterByUpdate method
  - Managed regex-related testing challenges by properly mocking the Regex class
  - Identified limitation with triple-colon format that will need future improvement
  - Recognized that while tests provide coverage, validation in the actual plugin environment is still needed

- **Latest Test Coverage Strategy:**
  - Targeted remaining uncovered code in Parser class, especially error handling paths
  - Created specialized tests for DOM-related operations with proper mocking
  - Used environment variable control to test different execution paths
  - Added tests that account for HTML entity encoding in parser output
  - Focused on comprehensive testing of utility methods used in parsing process

- **Previous Test Coverage Improvement Strategy:**
  - Focused on Parser class as the most complex component with lower coverage
  - Identified specific edge cases and complex parsing scenarios to test
  - Created specific tests for Markdown formatting, image/audio links, math notation, and embed content
  - Used direct testing of private methods to target hard-to-reach code paths
  - Emphasized tests for scenarios that are likely to occur in real usage

- **Documentation Strategy:**
  - Initial focus was on improving test coverage for better code maintainability
  - Shifted to comprehensive documentation of system architecture and technical context
  - Created detailed architecture documentation in `systemPatterns.md` using MVC as a conceptual framework
  - Enhanced technical context in `techContext.md` with clear sections on technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies, and tools
  - Documentation now provides a clear picture of how the plugin works internally

- **Initial Test Coverage Improvement:**
  - Initially focused on increasing overall coverage
  - Identified specific areas (entity classes) with lower coverage for targeted improvement
  - Added comprehensive tests for all card types and processing functions
  - Used TDD approach to diagnose and fix bugs
  - Most recent effort targeted Parser class edge cases and complex scenarios

- **Inline Card Parsing:**
  - Discovered bug with multi-line inline cards not including additional content lines
  - Debugged using Jest tests and console logging
  - Fixed by correcting regex capture group indices and refining the `isNextCardStart` check

- **Anki Card ID Format:**
  - Changed from `^1234567890` to HTML comment `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->`
  - Updated all related regexes and functions to support the new format
  - This avoids conflicts with Obsidian block references

- **Image Handling:**
  - Fixed rendering for wikilinks with dimensions
  - Extended support for `webp` and `avif` image formats
  - Adopted direct generation with cleanup approach for handling image links
