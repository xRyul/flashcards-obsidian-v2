# Active Context

* **Current Focus:** Improving usability and robustness of card synchronization logic.
* **Recent Changes:**
    * **Default Toggle Settings:** Enabled `sourceSupport` and `codeHighlightSupport` by default in `main.ts` (`getDefaultSettings`).
    * **Settings UI Clarity:** Renamed "Context-aware mode" setting to "Heading breadcrumbs" and refined its description in `src/gui/settings-tab.ts` for better user understanding.
    * **Missing Deck Key Notification:** Added a user notice in `CardsService.execute` that appears when YAML frontmatter exists but lacks the `cards-deck` key. The notice informs the user that the default deck is being used and suggests adding the key.
    * **Robust Card Recreation:** Fixed an issue where deleting a deck in Anki and then syncing could lead to duplicate Anki ID blocks in Obsidian.
        * Modified `CardsService.filterByUpdate` to detect when a card ID exists in the Obsidian note but not in Anki.
        * In this scenario, the card is now correctly queued for creation (with `id = -1`, `inserted = false`).
        * The original, now obsolete, Anki ID is marked for removal.
        * Added a final cleanup step in `CardsService.execute` (before saving the file) to remove all marked obsolete ID blocks from the file content (`this.file`).
        * This prevents duplicate IDs and ensures correct placement of new IDs.
    * **Removed "Inline ID Support" Setting:**
        * **Reason:** The setting only affected parsing regex, not ID writing, causing inconsistent behavior. The standard is now newline-separated HTML comment IDs (`<!-- ankiID: ... -->`).
        * **Actions:**
            * Removed setting from UI (`src/gui/settings-tab.ts`).
            * Removed `inlineID` property from `ISettings` interface (`src/conf/settings.ts`) and default/mock settings (`main.ts`, `tests/unit/parser.test.ts`).
            * Simplified `cardsInlineStyle` regex in `src/conf/regex.ts` to only expect newline IDs.
    * **Updated TypeScript Target:** Changed `target` in `tsconfig.json` from `es5` to `es2018` to support Unicode property escapes (`\p{...}`) used in regex.
    * **Corrected Settings Definitions:**
        * Removed erroneous `regex: IRegex` property from `ISettings` interface (`src/conf/settings.ts`).
        * Added missing `folder: ""` property to default settings (`main.ts`) and mock settings (`tests/unit/parser.test.ts`).
    * **Clarified Code Highlight Implementation:** Determined that "Code highlight support" setting modifies Anki card templates via `src/services/anki.ts` to include/exclude highlighting CSS/JS, rather than changing HTML generated by the parser.
    * **Fixed Duplicate Creation Error during ID Recovery:**
        * **Problem:** Cards without IDs in Obsidian were sometimes incorrectly sent for creation, causing a duplicate error from Anki because Anki's duplicate check (likely first-field based) identified a match that the plugin's stricter check (all fields + tags) missed.
        * **Solution:**
            * Modified `CardsService.execute` to fetch all notes from the target Anki deck using a new `Anki.getNotesInDeck` method.
            * Updated `CardsService.filterByUpdate` to use this complete list for the ID recovery comparison.
            * Introduced a new `Card.looselyMatchesFrontField` method that compares only the first field (typically 'Front').
            * Implemented a two-step matching process in `filterByUpdate` for cards without IDs:
                1. Use `looselyMatchesFrontField` to find potential matches and recover the Anki ID.
                2. If an ID is recovered, use the original strict `Card.match` method to determine if the recovered card also needs to be *updated* (due to differences in other fields or tags).
            * Updated unit tests (`cards.service.test.ts`) to reflect the changed signature of `filterByUpdate`.
    * **Enhanced Logging for ID Recovery:** Added detailed `console.debug` and `console.warn` messages in `filterByUpdate` and `Card.match`/`looselyMatchesFrontField` to diagnose matching issues.
    * **Further Improved Test Coverage for Parser Class:**
        * Increased overall code coverage from 93.84% to 94.99%.
        * Improved Parser class coverage from 92.22% to 94.13%.
        * Added additional comprehensive tests for:
          * Math notation parsing (inline and block math with complex formulas)
          * Image processing with various formats and dimensions (including webp and avif)
          * Audio link handling and conversion
          * Embed content processing and error handling
          * Context-aware mode with nested headings
          * Code blocks (both block and inline)
          * Error handling in DOM-related operations
        * Targeted previously uncovered error handling paths with specific tests
        * Added enhanced mocking for DOM elements and environment variables
        * Created detailed testing for utility functions like `getEmbedMap` and `getEmbedWrapContent`
    * **Testing Strategy Refinements:**
        * Focused on hard-to-reach error handling paths to maximize coverage
        * Created specialized test cases for HTML entity encoding/decoding issues
        * Added tests that specifically target edge cases in error handling
        * Implemented proper mock restoration to prevent test pollution
        * Adapted expectations to account for HTML encoding in parser output
    * **Previous Test Coverage Improvements:**
        * Increased overall code coverage from 91.98% to 93.84%.
        * Improved Parser class coverage from 89.47% to 92.22%.
        * Added comprehensive tests for:
          * Complex Markdown parsing scenarios
          * Edge cases in image and audio link processing
          * Cloze card formatting with various syntax options
          * Math notation conversion
          * Embed content processing
        * Used direct method testing to access private methods and harder-to-reach code paths
        * Focused on realistic usage scenarios that could occur in production
    * **Testing Strategy:**
        * Identified specific edge cases and complex parsing scenarios that needed coverage
        * Created targeted tests for each feature area
        * Used parameterized tests to efficiently test multiple variations
        * Ensured tests match actual implementation behavior rather than idealized expectations
    * **Previous Documentation:**
        * Added detailed architecture overview to `systemPatterns.md` including:
          * Plugin Architecture inspired by MVC pattern
          * Core components breakdown (Main Controller, View Layer, Service Layer, Data Layer)
          * Key technical decisions (TypeScript, error handling, Obsidian Plugin API)
          * Design patterns in use (Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Observer, Regex-based Parsing)
          * Component relationships and interactions
          * Critical implementation paths for file processing and Anki interaction
        * Enhanced `techContext.md` with comprehensive details on:
          * Technologies used (TypeScript, Obsidian API, AnkiConnect API, Showdown)
          * Development setup requirements and workflow
          * Technical constraints and platform compatibility considerations
          * Dependency management and tool usage patterns
          * Markdown processing approach
    * **Initial Test Coverage Improvements:**
        * Increased overall code coverage from 81.47% to 91.98%.
        * Improved entity classes coverage from 63.15% to 97.89%.
        * Added comprehensive tests for all card types (standard, inline, spaced, cloze).
        * Added tests for image and audio processing in cards.
        * Added tests for context-aware mode with headings.
        * Added tests for utility functions like `arraysEqual` and `escapeMarkdown`.
        * Fixed existing failing tests to match actual implementation behavior.
    * Deleted the `docs/` directory as it was deemed unnecessary (contained contributor info, demo assets).
    * Removed the link to the demo image (`docs/demo.gif`) from `README.md`.
    * Added `memory-bank/` and `coverage/` directories to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking Memory Bank and test coverage reports.
    * **Fixed Multi-line Inline Card Parsing:**
        * **Issue:** Inline cards (`::`) followed by additional content lines (e.g., `(slide 135)`) were incorrectly parsed. The additional lines were not included in the answer, and the Anki ID was placed before them.
        * **Debugging:** Added a Jest test case (`tests/unit/parser.test.ts`) specifically for this scenario. Used console logging to trace the issue to incorrect regex group indexing and overly broad card start detection within the answer collection loop in `generateInlineCards` (`src/services/parser.ts`).
        * **Fix:**
            * Corrected the regex capture group indices used in `generateInlineCards` to accurately extract the question (`match[2]`) and the first line of the answer (`match[4]`).
            * Refined the `isNextCardStart` check within the answer collection loop to use `regex.exec()` and validate `match.index === 0`, ensuring it only breaks the loop for genuine card start lines, not arbitrary content.
            * Ensured leading list markers (`- `, `* `, `+ `) are trimmed from the extracted question (`originalQuestion`) before processing.
    * Changed the Anki card ID format from `^1234567890` to HTML comment `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->`.
        * Updated regexes in `src/conf/regex.ts` to detect/extract the new format.
        * Updated `getIdFormat()` in all `Card` subclasses (`src/entities/*.ts`) to generate the new format.
        * Updated `Parser.getAnkiIDsBlocks` (`src/services/parser.ts`) to find existing IDs using the new HTML comment format.
        * Updated `CardsService.writeAnkiBlocks` (`src/services/cards.ts`) to ensure the new ID is added on a newline (only adding the newline if one doesn't already precede the insertion point).
        * Updated deletion commands in `main.ts` to use the new ID regex and cleanup logic.
        * Refactored `Parser.generateCardsWithTag` (`src/services/parser.ts`): Simplified the `flashscardsWithTag` regex (`src/conf/regex.ts`) to only match the first line of a #card tag block. Implemented programmatic logic within `generateCardsWithTag` to iterate subsequent lines to find the answer content and optional ID block. This fixes a bug where cards (especially list items) at the end of the file might not be parsed if preceding cards had ID blocks.
        * Refactored `CardsService.filterByUpdate` to more reliably differentiate new cards from existing ones by cross-referencing parsed card IDs with the set of IDs actually found in the file, fixing a bug where new cards might not be created if other cards already had IDs.
    * Fixed image rendering for wikilinks with dimensions (e.g., `![[image.webp|100x100]]`).
        * Updated image regexes (`wikiImageLinks`, `markdownImageLinks` in `src/conf/regex.ts`) to support `webp` and `avif` formats and capture filename, width, and height separately.
        * Modified `substituteImageLinks` in `src/services/parser.ts` to generate correct `<img src='...' width='...' height='...'>` tags directly.
        * Added a cleanup step in `parseLine` (`src/services/parser.ts`) to remove potentially duplicated embed HTML (`<div class="internal-embed...">`) generated by `showdown` after the correct `<img>` tag.
        * Previous attempts using placeholders (`@@IMAGE::...@@`) failed due to complex interactions with `showdown` or placeholder mismatches.
    * **Added Content-Based ID Recovery:**
        * Implemented a mechanism to recover Anki IDs for cards that have lost their ID in Obsidian
        * When a card is found without an ID in Obsidian, system now checks all Anki cards for content matches
        * If a match is found, the existing Anki ID is automatically recovered and added back to the note in Obsidian
        * This prevents duplicate cards when a user accidentally deletes card IDs
        * Implementation added to `CardsService.filterByUpdate` method with a new helper `addMissingIdToCard`
        * Enhanced robustness by tracking previously matched Anki cards to avoid duplicate matches
    * **HTML Comment Parsing Restriction:** The parser now ignores all content inside HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) except for lines that exactly match the Anki ID pattern (`<!-- ankiID: ... -->`).
        * **Rationale:** Prevents accidental card creation from commented-out text, cloze, or tags, as reported by users. Only ID management is allowed in comments.
        * **Implementation:** Preprocessing step in `generateFlashcards` strips all comment content except for valid ID lines before card extraction.
        * **Pattern:** Defensive preprocessing to enforce strict parsing boundaries.
        * **Learnings:** Markdown/Obsidian users often use comments for annotation or disabling content; parser must be robust to such usage.
* **Next Steps:**
    * Test the card recreation logic thoroughly in various scenarios.
    * Consider further improvements to user feedback during sync operations.
    * Continue improving test coverage for other components.
* **Active Decisions:**
    * **Card Recreation Strategy:** When an ID exists in Obsidian but not Anki:
        1. Mark the obsolete ID for removal (store it in `idsToRemoveFromFile`).
        2. Reset the card's ID (`-1`) and `inserted` status (`false`) and queue it for creation.
        3. After all Anki operations and *new* ID writing, perform a final cleanup step to remove the lines containing the marked obsolete IDs from the file content before saving. This ensures correct offsets for new ID placement.
    * **User Feedback:** Provide specific feedback (like the missing `cards-deck` notice) rather than silently falling back or auto-correcting potentially unwantedly.
    * **Settings Defaults:** Enable key features like source and code highlighting by default for a better out-of-the-box experience.
    * **Settings Naming:** Prefer descriptive and user-friendly names for settings (e.g., "Heading breadcrumbs").
* **Patterns & Preferences:**
    * **Error/Edge Case Handling:** Address specific sync edge cases (like deleted decks) robustly to prevent data duplication or loss.
    * **Deferred File Modification:** Delay destructive file modifications (like removing old IDs) until after constructive modifications (like adding new IDs) are complete to avoid offset calculation issues.
    * **Clear User Feedback:** Inform users about fallback behaviors or potential configuration issues (e.g., missing frontmatter keys) via notices.
    * **Settings UX:** Use clear, understandable names and descriptions for settings.
* **Learnings & Insights:**
    * Modifying file content (e.g., removing lines) during iterative processing can invalidate previously calculated offsets, requiring careful management of modification order or deferred cleanup.
    * Handling synchronization edge cases where the state differs significantly between Obsidian and Anki (e.g., deleted decks) requires specific logic beyond simple create/update checks.
    * User-facing labels and descriptions need careful consideration for clarity.

* **Previous Focus:** Comprehensive documentation of system architecture and technical context.
* **Previously:**
    * Created comprehensive test suite covering all card types, entity classes, and utility functions.
    * Made tests more flexible to accommodate implementation changes.
    * Added specific test cases for previously fixed bugs to prevent regressions.
    * Removed `docs/` directory and associated README link.
    * Ignored `memory-bank/` and `coverage/` in git.
    * Adopted multi-line answer collection logic for inline cards (`::`, `:::`) similar to `#card` style, ensuring subsequent non-empty lines are included before the ID block.
    * Adopted `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->` as the new format for Anki card IDs to avoid conflicts with Obsidian block references (`^block-id`). Removed support for the old `^...` format.
    * Adopted a "direct generation + cleanup" approach for handling image links in the parser.
    * Extended supported image formats to include `webp` and `avif`.
* **Patterns & Preferences:**
    * Commands are added to `main.ts` using `addCommand` with an `editorCallback`.
    * Service logic is separated into `src/services/cards.ts`.
    * User notifications are provided via `new Notice()`.
    * Anki ID blocks are consistently formatted as `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->` and located on their own line following the card content.
* **Learnings & Insights:** 
    * **Code Highlight Mechanism:** Syntax highlighting is managed via Anki template modification based on the `codeHighlightSupport` setting.
    * Simple regex replace on file content can break formatting; line-based processing (split, filter, join) is safer for preserving layout when removing specific lines.
    * Standard card regex (`flashscardsWithTag`) needs to account for optional leading blockquote markers (`> `) to parse cards defined within callouts or blockquotes.
