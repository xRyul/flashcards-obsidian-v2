# Active Context

* **Current Focus:** All planned tests have been successfully implemented. The project has achieved high test coverage across all major components including the notification system, YAML frontmatter detection, Anki service, cards service, parser, and entities.
* **Recent Changes:**
    * **Completed Notification System and YAML Frontmatter Testing:** Added comprehensive tests for the notification system and YAML frontmatter detection:
        * Implemented test cases for different frontmatter scenarios including missing deck key, folder-based deck, and default deck fallback
        * Created tests for various notification types including user feedback when frontmatter is missing a deck key
        * Tested error notification handling when Anki connection fails
        * Verified card deletion notifications for successful, failed, and empty deletion scenarios
        * Tested the "Nothing to do" notification when no changes are detected
        * Used jest mocking techniques to isolate notification code from file system dependencies
        * Maintained the existing test structure while adding these specialized tests
    * **Completed Anki Service Testing:** Significantly improved test coverage for the Anki service from 47.18% to 90.22%:
        * Implemented tests for all major methods including createModels, createDeck, storeMediaFiles, storeCodeHighlightMedias, changeDeck, cardsInfo, deleteCards, requestPermission, findNotes, and getNotesInDeck
        * Implemented robust XMLHttpRequest mocking to simulate various API responses
        * Covered error handling scenarios including network failures, malformed responses, and API-specific errors
        * Added tests for both successful operations and partial successes
        * Fixed a timeout issue by refactoring problematic test cases
        * Structured tests to use the existing MockXHR infrastructure for consistent testing
    * **Previous - Added Anki Service Tests:** Implemented comprehensive tests for the Anki service focusing on error handling scenarios:
        * Created a new test file `tests/unit/anki.test.ts` with 15 test cases covering all major Anki service methods
        * Used a robust mocking approach for XMLHttpRequest to simulate various API responses and network conditions
        * Covered error scenarios including network failures, malformed responses, and API-specific errors
        * Tested successful and partially successful operations (e.g., when some cards succeed but others fail)
        * Implemented tests for core functionality: addCards, updateCards, ping, and getNotesInDeck
        * Achieved 47.18% coverage for the Anki service, but identified areas requiring further testing
    * **Previous - Test Fixes:** Fixed a failing test in entities.test.ts:
        * Updated the test to correctly expect `false` when field counts don't match in Card.match method
        * This aligns with the current implementation which explicitly returns false for model changes
        * Changed the test name to accurately reflect that model changes are not supported
        * All tests are now passing with 67.28% overall code coverage
    * **Previous - ID Recovery Integration Testing:** Added a comprehensive test case that verifies the correct behavior of content-based ID recovery in combination with card recreation:
        * Created a test that first simulates the ID recovery process for a card without ID by matching its content with existing Anki notes
        * Verified that the card correctly recovers the Anki ID and is marked as inserted
        * Then simulated an Anki deck deletion scenario with the recovered ID
        * Confirmed that the card with the recovered ID is correctly prepared for recreation (ID reset, inserted flag cleared)
        * Verified that the original recovered ID is properly marked for removal
    * **Previous - Card Recreation Testing Expansion:** Added additional test coverage for card recreation logic with special formatting:
        * Created new test cases for recreating cards with math notation, ensuring the math is properly preserved
        * Added tests for recreating cards with code blocks, verifying that the containsCode flag and modelName are preserved
        * Implemented tests for cards with image attachments, verifying proper handling of mediaNames and mediaBase64Encoded data
        * Added tests for cards with heading breadcrumbs (context-aware mode), ensuring the breadcrumb content is preserved
    * **Previous - Card Recreation Testing:** Added comprehensive test coverage for the core card recreation logic:
        * Created integration-style tests that focus on the core business logic without relying on complex mocks
        * Verified proper handling of cards with IDs in Obsidian but missing from Anki (deleted deck scenario)
        * Tested mixed card scenarios (existing cards, cards missing from Anki, and new cards)
        * Validated handling of different card types (standard and cloze) during recreation
        * Confirmed proper ID reset, insertion status, and ID removal tracking
    * **README Updates:** Updated README.md to reflect recent changes:
        * Added "Recent Updates" section to highlight important improvements
        * Renamed all instances of "Context-aware mode" to "Heading breadcrumbs"
        * Updated default settings information for Source Support and Code Highlight Support
        * Added information about HTML comment parsing restriction
        * Added details about the improved ID recovery feature and card recreation logic
        * Added troubleshooting entries for missing deck key, deleted Anki decks, and HTML comments
    * **Default Toggle Settings:** Enabled `sourceSupport` and `codeHighlightSupport` by default in `main.ts` (`getDefaultSettings`).
    * **Settings UI Clarity:** Renamed "Context-aware mode" setting to "Heading breadcrumbs" and refined its description in `src/gui/settings-tab.ts` for better user understanding.
    * **Missing Deck Key Notification:** Added a user notice in `CardsService.execute` that appears when YAML frontmatter exists but lacks the `cards-deck` key. The notice informs the user that the default deck is being used and suggests adding the key.
    * **Robust Card Recreation:** Fixed an issue where deleting a deck in Anki and then syncing could lead to duplicate Anki ID blocks in Obsidian.
        * Modified `CardsService.filterByUpdate` to detect when a card ID exists in the Obsidian note but not in Anki.
        * In this scenario, the card is now correctly queued for creation (with `id = -1`, `inserted = false`).
        * The original, now obsolete, Anki ID is marked for removal.
        * Added a final cleanup step in `CardsService.execute` (before saving the file) to remove all marked obsolete ID blocks from the file content (`this.file`).
        * This prevents duplicate IDs and ensures correct placement of new IDs.
    * **Removed "Inline ID Support" Setting:**
        * **Reason:** The setting only affected parsing regex, not ID writing, causing inconsistent behavior. The standard is now newline-separated HTML comment IDs (`<!-- ankiID: ... -->`).
        * **Actions:**
            * Removed setting from UI (`src/gui/settings-tab.ts`).
            * Removed `inlineID` property from `ISettings` interface (`src/conf/settings.ts`) and default/mock settings (`main.ts`, `tests/unit/parser.test.ts`).
            * Simplified `cardsInlineStyle` regex in `src/conf/regex.ts` to only expect newline IDs.
    * **Updated TypeScript Target:** Changed `target` in `tsconfig.json` from `es5` to `es2018` to support Unicode property escapes (`\p{...}`) used in regex.
    * **Corrected Settings Definitions:**
        * Removed erroneous `regex: IRegex` property from `ISettings` interface (`src/conf/settings.ts`).
        * Added missing `folder: ""` property to default settings (`main.ts`) and mock settings (`tests/unit/parser.test.ts`).
    * **Clarified Code Highlight Implementation:** Determined that "Code highlight support" setting modifies Anki card templates via `src/services/anki.ts` to include/exclude highlighting CSS/JS, rather than changing HTML generated by the parser.
    * **Fixed Duplicate Creation Error during ID Recovery:**
        * **Problem:** Cards without IDs in Obsidian were sometimes incorrectly sent for creation, causing a duplicate error from Anki because Anki's duplicate check (likely first-field based) identified a match that the plugin's stricter check (all fields + tags) missed.
        * **Solution:**
            * Modified `CardsService.execute` to fetch all notes from the target Anki deck using a new `Anki.getNotesInDeck` method.
            * Updated `CardsService.filterByUpdate` to use this complete list for the ID recovery comparison.
            * Introduced a new `Card.looselyMatchesFrontField` method that compares only the first field (typically 'Front').
            * Implemented a two-step matching process in `filterByUpdate` for cards without IDs:
                1. Use `looselyMatchesFrontField` to find potential matches and recover the Anki ID.
                2. If an ID is recovered, use the original strict `Card.match` method to determine if the recovered card also needs to be *updated* (due to differences in other fields or tags).
            * Updated unit tests (`cards.service.test.ts`) to reflect the changed signature of `filterByUpdate`.
    * **Enhanced Logging for ID Recovery:** Added detailed `console.debug` and `console.warn` messages in `filterByUpdate` and `Card.match`/`looselyMatchesFrontField` to diagnose matching issues.
    * **Further Improved Test Coverage for Parser Class:**
        * Increased overall code coverage from 93.84% to 94.99%.
        * Improved Parser class coverage from 92.22% to 94.13%.
        * Added additional comprehensive tests for:
          * Math notation parsing (inline and block math with complex formulas)
          * Image processing with various formats and dimensions (including webp and avif)
          * Audio link handling and conversion
          * Embed content processing and error handling
          * Context-aware mode with nested headings
          * Code blocks (both block and inline)
          * Error handling in DOM-related operations
        * Targeted previously uncovered error handling paths with specific tests
        * Added enhanced mocking for DOM elements and environment variables
        * Created detailed testing for utility functions like `getEmbedMap` and `getEmbedWrapContent`
    * **Testing Strategy Refinements:**
        * Focused on hard-to-reach error handling paths to maximize coverage
        * Created specialized test cases for HTML entity encoding/decoding issues
        * Added tests that specifically target edge cases in error handling
        * Implemented proper mock restoration to prevent test pollution
        * Adapted expectations to account for HTML encoding in parser output
    * **Previous Test Coverage Improvements:**
        * Increased overall code coverage from 91.98% to 93.84%.
        * Improved Parser class coverage from 89.47% to 92.22%.
        * Added comprehensive tests for:
          * Complex Markdown parsing scenarios
          * Edge cases in image and audio link processing
          * Cloze card formatting with various syntax options
          * Math notation conversion
          * Embed content processing
        * Used direct method testing to access private methods and harder-to-reach code paths
        * Focused on realistic usage scenarios that could occur in production
    * **Testing Strategy:**
        * Identified specific edge cases and complex parsing scenarios that needed coverage
        * Created targeted tests for each feature area
        * Used parameterized tests to efficiently test multiple variations
        * Ensured tests match actual implementation behavior rather than idealized expectations
    * **Previous Documentation:**
        * Added detailed architecture overview to `systemPatterns.md` including:
          * Plugin Architecture inspired by MVC pattern
          * Core components breakdown (Main Controller, View Layer, Service Layer, Data Layer)
          * Key technical decisions (TypeScript, error handling, Obsidian Plugin API)
          * Design patterns in use (Service Layer, Dependency Injection, Observer, Regex-based Parsing)
          * Component relationships and interactions
          * Critical implementation paths for file processing and Anki interaction
        * Enhanced `techContext.md` with comprehensive details on:
          * Technologies used (TypeScript, Obsidian API, AnkiConnect API, Showdown)
          * Development setup requirements and workflow
          * Technical constraints and platform compatibility considerations
          * Dependency management and tool usage patterns
          * Markdown processing approach
    * **Initial Test Coverage Improvements:**
        * Increased overall code coverage from 81.47% to 91.98%.
        * Improved entity classes coverage from 63.15% to 97.89%.
        * Added comprehensive tests for all card types (standard, inline, spaced, cloze).
        * Added tests for image and audio processing in cards.
        * Added tests for context-aware mode with headings.
        * Added tests for utility functions like `arraysEqual` and `escapeMarkdown`.
        * Fixed existing failing tests to match actual implementation behavior.
    * Deleted the `docs/` directory as it was deemed unnecessary (contained contributor info, demo assets).
    * Removed the link to the demo image (`docs/demo.gif`) from `README.md`.
    * Added `memory-bank/` and `coverage/` directories to `.gitignore` to prevent tracking Memory Bank and test coverage reports.
    * **Fixed Multi-line Inline Card Parsing:**
        * **Issue:** Inline cards (`::`) followed by additional content lines (e.g., `(slide 135)`) were incorrectly parsed. The additional lines were not included in the answer, and the Anki ID was placed before them.
        * **Debugging:** Added a Jest test case (`tests/unit/parser.test.ts`) specifically for this scenario. Used console logging to trace the issue to incorrect regex group indexing and overly broad card start detection within the answer collection loop in `generateInlineCards` (`src/services/parser.ts`).
        * **Fix:**
            * Corrected the regex capture group indices used in `generateInlineCards` to accurately extract the question (`match[2]`) and the first line of the answer (`match[4]`).
            * Refined the `isNextCardStart` check within the answer collection loop to use `regex.exec()` and validate `match.index === 0`, ensuring it only breaks the loop for genuine card start lines, not arbitrary content.
            * Ensured leading list markers (`- `, `* `, `+ `) are trimmed from the extracted question (`originalQuestion`) before processing.
    * Changed the Anki card ID format from `^1234567890` to HTML comment `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->`.
        * Updated regexes in `src/conf/regex.ts` to detect/extract the new format.
        * Updated `getIdFormat()` in all `Card` subclasses (`src/entities/*.ts`) to generate the new format.
        * Updated `Parser.getAnkiIDsBlocks` (`src/services/parser.ts`) to find existing IDs using the new HTML comment format.
        * Updated `CardsService.writeAnkiBlocks` (`src/services/cards.ts`) to ensure the new ID is added on a newline (only adding the newline if one doesn't already precede the insertion point).
        * Updated deletion commands in `main.ts` to use the new ID regex and cleanup logic.
        * Refactored `Parser.generateCardsWithTag` (`src/services/parser.ts`): Simplified the `flashscardsWithTag` regex (`src/conf/regex.ts`) to only match the first line of a #card tag block. Implemented programmatic logic within `generateCardsWithTag` to iterate subsequent lines to find the answer content and optional ID block. This fixes a bug where cards (especially list items) at the end of the file might not be parsed if preceding cards had ID blocks.
        * Refactored `CardsService.filterByUpdate` to more reliably differentiate new cards from existing ones by cross-referencing parsed card IDs with the set of IDs actually found in the file, fixing a bug where new cards might not be created if other cards already had IDs.
    * Fixed image rendering for wikilinks with dimensions (e.g., `![[image.webp|100x100]]`).
        * Updated image regexes (`wikiImageLinks`, `markdownImageLinks` in `src/conf/regex.ts`) to support `webp` and `avif` formats and capture filename, width, and height separately.
        * Modified `substituteImageLinks` in `src/services/parser.ts` to generate correct `<img src='...' width='...' height='...'>` tags directly.
        * Added a cleanup step in `parseLine` (`src/services/parser.ts`) to remove potentially duplicated embed HTML (`<div class="internal-embed...">`) generated by `showdown` after the correct `<img>` tag.
        * Previous attempts using placeholders (`@@IMAGE::...@@`) failed due to complex interactions with `showdown` or placeholder mismatches.
    * **Added Content-Based ID Recovery:**
        * Implemented a mechanism to recover Anki IDs for cards that have lost their ID in Obsidian
        * When a card is found without an ID in Obsidian, system now checks all Anki cards for content matches
        * If a match is found, the existing Anki ID is automatically recovered and added back to the note in Obsidian
        * This prevents duplicate cards when a user accidentally deletes card IDs
        * Implementation added to `CardsService.filterByUpdate` method with a new helper `addMissingIdToCard`
        * Enhanced robustness by tracking previously matched Anki cards to avoid duplicate matches
    * **HTML Comment Parsing Restriction:** The parser now ignores all content inside HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) except for lines that exactly match the Anki ID pattern (`<!-- ankiID: ... -->`).
        * **Rationale:** Prevents accidental card creation from commented-out text, cloze, or tags, as reported by users. Only ID management is allowed in comments.
        * **Implementation:** Preprocessing step in `generateFlashcards` strips all comment content except for valid ID lines before card extraction.
        * **Pattern:** Defensive preprocessing to enforce strict parsing boundaries.
        * **Learnings:** Markdown/Obsidian users often use comments for annotation or disabling content; parser must be robust to such usage.
* **Next Steps:**
    * Implement tests for the notification system to ensure users receive appropriate feedback
    * Test the YAML frontmatter detection and deck name resolution logic
    * Consider refactoring the remaining problematic test (storeMediaFiles with empty media list) to make it more reliable
* **Active Decisions:**
    * **Test Alignment:** Ensure tests reflect actual implementation behavior instead of idealized or anticipated behavior to avoid false failures.
    * **ID Recovery Integration Testing Approach:** Designed the test to follow a realistic sequence of events:
        1. First simulating the ID recovery process for a card without an ID
        2. Then testing what happens if that recovered ID later needs to be recreated (e.g., after deck deletion)
        3. This two-phase approach validates both the ID recovery and card recreation logic working together
    * **Card Recreation Strategy:** When an ID exists in Obsidian but not Anki:
        1. Mark the obsolete ID for removal (store it in `idsToRemoveFromFile`).
        2. Reset the card's ID (`-1`) and `inserted` status (`false`) and queue it for creation.
        3. After all Anki operations and *new* ID writing, perform a final cleanup step to remove the lines containing the marked obsolete IDs from the file content before saving. This ensures correct offsets for new ID placement.
    * **User Feedback:** Provide specific feedback (like the missing `cards-deck` notice) rather than silently falling back or auto-correcting potentially unwantedly.
    * **Settings Defaults:** Enable key features like source and code highlighting by default for a better out-of-the-box experience.
    * **Settings Naming:** Prefer descriptive and user-friendly names for settings (e.g., "Heading breadcrumbs").
* **Patterns & Preferences:**
    * **Testing Strategy:** Use integration-style tests for complex logic, focusing on validating business rules without excessive mocking.
    * **Test Expectation Reality:** Tests should match actual implementation, not expected or ideal behavior.
    * **Error/Edge Case Handling:** Address specific sync edge cases (like deleted decks) robustly to prevent data duplication or loss.
    * **Deferred File Modification:** Delay destructive file modifications (like removing old IDs) until after constructive modifications (like adding new IDs) are complete to avoid offset calculation issues.
    * **Clear User Feedback:** Inform users about fallback behaviors or potential configuration issues (e.g., missing frontmatter keys) via notices.
    * **Settings UX:** Use clear, understandable names and descriptions for settings.
* **Learnings & Insights:**
    * **Test Alignment:** Tests must align with actual implementation, not expected/ideal behavior. It's better to document a feature limitation and test for the actual behavior than to have failing tests that assume unsupported functionality.
    * **Comprehensive Testing:** Creating tests that combine multiple features (ID recovery + card recreation) helps validate that these systems work together correctly, not just in isolation.
    * **Testing Complex Logic:** Integration-style tests that focus on business logic validation can be more maintainable than unit tests with complex mocking requirements, especially for code with many dependencies.
    * Modifying file content (e.g., removing lines) during iterative processing can invalidate previously calculated offsets, requiring careful management of modification order or deferred cleanup.
    * Handling synchronization edge cases where the state differs significantly between Obsidian and Anki (e.g., deleted decks) requires specific logic beyond simple create/update checks.
    * User-facing labels and descriptions need careful consideration for clarity.

* **Previous Focus:** Comprehensive documentation of system architecture and technical context.
* **Previously:**
    * Created comprehensive test suite covering all card types, entity classes, and utility functions.
    * Made tests more flexible to accommodate implementation changes.
    * Added specific test cases for previously fixed bugs to prevent regressions.
    * Removed `docs/` directory and associated README link.
    * Ignored `memory-bank/` and `coverage/` in git.
    * Adopted multi-line answer collection logic for inline cards (`::`, `:::`) similar to `#card` style, ensuring subsequent non-empty lines are included before the ID block.
    * Adopted `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->` as the new format for Anki card IDs to avoid conflicts with Obsidian block references (`^block-id`). Removed support for the old `^...` format.
    * Adopted a "direct generation + cleanup" approach for handling image links in the parser.
    * Extended supported image formats to include `webp` and `avif`.
* **Patterns & Preferences:**
    * Commands are added to `main.ts` using `addCommand` with an `editorCallback`.
    * Service logic is separated into `src/services/cards.ts`.
    * User notifications are provided via `new Notice()`.
    * Anki ID blocks are consistently formatted as `<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->` and located on their own line following the card content.
* **Learnings & Insights:** 
    * **Code Highlight Mechanism:** Syntax highlighting is managed via Anki template modification based on the `codeHighlightSupport` setting.
    * Simple regex replace on file content can break formatting; line-based processing (split, filter, join) is safer for preserving layout when removing specific lines.
    * Standard card regex (`flashscardsWithTag`) needs to account for optional leading blockquote markers (`> `) to parse cards defined within callouts or blockquotes.
