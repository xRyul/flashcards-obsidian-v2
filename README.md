## Recent Updates
- **Improved Card Recreation:** Cards are now automatically recreated if they exist in Obsidian but are missing from Anki (e.g., when decks are deleted in Anki)
- **Enhanced ID Recovery:** The plugin now recovers missing Anki IDs by matching card content with existing cards in Anki
- **Default Settings Improved:** "Source Support" and "Code Highlight Support" are now enabled by default
- **Renamed Features:** "Context-aware mode" has been renamed to "Heading breadcrumbs" for clarity
- **HTML Comment Safety:** Content inside HTML comments is now ignored for card creation (except for Anki ID comments)
- **Better User Feedback:** Added notifications for missing configuration like the `cards-deck` key in frontmatter

## How to use it?

1. Define a hashtag - default is #card
2. Front: To define the front of the card simply add #card at the end of the line. 
3. Back: Back will be automatically created until a linebreak

```markdown
# This could be a title

## This is the front #card    
This is the back of the card.

This line will not be part of it, because there is an empty line above.

### This is a normal and reversed card #card-reverse
Which means that two cards will be generated on Anki.

### Also revers #card/reverse
But this time it uses Obsidian hierarchical tags.

### This could be another question #card
But this time without the heading.

## This is another way to define the front
#card 
This style is usefull to avoid the hashtags when referencing in Obsidian
```

### Inline style with ::
```markdown
My question::My answer
My question:: My answer
My question ::My Answer
My question :: My answer
- My list item question:: My list item answer
```

Inline style with multiline:
```markdown
Question::Answer Line 1
Answer Line 2
(Any subsequent non-empty lines before the next card or ID block are part of the answer)
```

#### Reverse
To create a reversed card with the inline style just use `:::`. Multi-line answers work the same way.
```markdown
My question:::My answer
My question::: My answer
My question :::My Answer
My question ::: My answer

Question:::Answer Line 1
Answer Line 2
Answer Line 3
(Any subsequent non-empty lines before the next card or ID block are part of the answer)
```

### Cloze
```
This is a way to define a ==cloze== by using the Obsidian highlight syntax in order to avoid making notes dirty.
The alternative is this type of {cloze} that is totally equal to {1:cloze}. With the number you can specify the order {2:later cloze}.
```

### Spaced with `#card-spaced` or `#card/spaced` hashtag
```markdown
This could be a beautifull quote that you want to see once in a while #card-spaced
```


## Generate cards on Anki
1. In Obsidian, open the file where you have the flashcards
2. Then to insert/update/delete just run inside Obsidian the command `Ctrl+p` and execute the command `Flashcards: Generate for the current file`

### Insert
Write the cards and just run the command above. The insertion operation will add cards on Anki. In Obsidian, it will add an HTML comment containing the Anki card ID (`<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->`) on the line immediately following **all** of the card's content (including any multi-line answers for both `#card` and `::`/`:::` styles). This ID is used to track the card for updates and deletions.

Example (`#card`):
```markdown
Question? #card
Answer line 1.
Answer line 2.
<!-- ankiID: 1712345678901 -->
```

Example (`::`):
```markdown
My Inline Question::My Answer Line 1
My Answer Line 2
<!-- ankiID: 1712345678902 -->
```

### Update
Just edit the card in Obsidian, and run the command `Flashcards: Generate for the current file` again.

### Automatic ID Recovery
If you accidentally delete the `<!-- ankiID: ... -->` comment from your Obsidian note, the plugin will attempt to automatically recover it during the next sync (`Flashcards: Generate for the current file`).

- It compares the content of cards without IDs in Obsidian to existing cards in the target Anki deck.
- It uses a matching logic primarily based on the card's first field (usually the "Front") to align with Anki's own duplicate detection.
- If a unique match is found based on the first field, the plugin recovers the missing Anki ID and inserts the `<!-- ankiID: ... -->` comment back into your Obsidian note.
- If the *other* fields (like "Back" or tags) differ between the Obsidian card and the matched Anki card, the card will also be marked for update in Anki.
- This prevents accidental duplicate card creation when IDs are removed in Obsidian.
- The plugin will also automatically recreate cards with IDs in Obsidian that are missing from Anki (e.g., when decks are deleted in Anki).

### HTML Comments
The plugin ignores all content inside HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) except for lines that exactly match the Anki ID pattern (`<!-- ankiID: ... -->`). This prevents accidental card creation from commented-out text, cloze, or tags.

### Deleting Cards Directly from Anki

This plugin provides two commands to delete cards directly from Anki and simultaneously clean up the corresponding ID blocks in your Obsidian notes:

1.  **Delete Selected Card(s) from Anki Only:**
    *   Select the text in your Obsidian note that contains the Anki card ID comment(s) (`<!-- ankiID: 1234567890 -->`) you want to delete.
    *   Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`).
    *   Run the command `Flashcards: Delete selected card(s) from Anki only`.
    *   The corresponding notes will be deleted from Anki, and the ID blocks within your selection will be removed from the Obsidian note.

2.  **Delete All Cards in Current File from Anki Only:**
    *   Open the Obsidian note containing the cards you wish to remove from Anki.
    *   Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+P` or `Cmd+P`).
    *   Run the command `Flashcards: Delete all cards in current file from Anki only`.
    *   The plugin will find all Anki ID comments (`<!-- ankiID: ... -->`) in the file, delete the corresponding notes from Anki, and remove the ID comment lines from the Obsidian note, preserving the note's layout.

**Note:** These commands *only* affect Anki and the ID blocks in Obsidian. They do not delete the original card content (front/back) from your Obsidian note. This allows you to keep the information in Obsidian even after removing the flashcard from Anki. If you run the sync command again after deleting from Anki only, the ID Recovery feature may add the ID back if the content still matches.

## Features

### Heading breadcrumbs (formerly Context-aware mode)
To make sense of notes, they should talk about a specific topic, so if you have two headings of level 1 (# heading), probably you should have two notes that talks about those topics. Moreover, the note itself is written with a tree-structure and then connected in a graph way. Based on this hypothesis, the heading breadcrumbs feature creates the context in the **front** of the card. Where the context the outline of the headings in a tree structure. The demo shows is in action. This helps you out:
- **during review**, because the front will be **unique** and this helps the memory in reaching for the correct answer. If the front is repeated for multiple cards, it's impossible to remember what's in the back, it's pure randomness.
- **during writing**, because you can write following the same structure for different topics, and cards will always be **unique**. So you do not have to think too much about the writing itself.

**Example:**
```markdown
# Computer Science

## Languages #card
Stuff

### OOP #card
Stuff

#### C++ #card
Stuff

#### Java #card
Answer

### Functional
Stuff
```

**Generated card for the Java heading**

- With heading breadcrumbs on üü¢
```
Front: Computer Science > Languages > OOP > Java
Back: Answer
```

- With heading breadcrumbs off üî¥
```
Front: Java
Back: Answer
```

### Deck
To define in which deck in Anki the cards should go, write the name of the deck in the [front matter](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter). You can even specify sub decks by using two colons, `My Deck Name::Sub deck`. If you want to change the deck after the cards have been generated, just change the deck name.

```markdown
---
cards-deck: My Deck Name
---

## This is the front #card    
This is the back of the card.
```
#### Folder-based deck name
This should be enabled in the settings. `Default: On`. It enables to automatically create cards into a deck that follows the hierarchical paths of where the note is.
For example, if you have a file in the path `food/italian/cavatelli.md`, then the cards will be generated in a deck named `food::italian`.

### Tags
To define the tags that should be used in Anki, there are two approaches.
- Global tags: takes all the tags specified after any line that starts with `tags:`. To hide them in the preview, just put them in the [front matter](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Advanced+topics/YAML+front+matter) of Obsidian.
- Local tags: takes the tag after the #card tag.

```markdown
---
tags: global-tag1, global-tag2
---

## This is the front #card #my-local-tag
This is the back of the card.
```
Global tags can even be defined in this manner: 
```markdown
tags: global-tag1, #global-tag2, [[global-tag3]]
```

or without the comma:
```markdown
tags: global-tag1 #global-tag2 [[global-tag3]]
```

### Images
To add images, just [embed](https://publish.obsidian.md/help/How+to/Embed+files) them normally.

### Code highlight support
This is enabled in the settings by default. You can disable it if needed.

### Source support
This is enabled in the settings by default. You can disable it if needed.    
Note that whenever enabled, the previous cards created without the source support cannot be updated, unless you switch back. My suggestion is to stick with one mode.

### LaTeX support
Just write your latex code by using the Obsidian syntax:
```md
This is an example
$3+4$
$$50+2$$
```

## Troubleshooting

*   **AnkiConnect Configuration:** If you have trouble connecting, ensure Anki is running with the AnkiConnect add-on installed and configured correctly. Open Anki, go to `Tools -> Add-ons -> AnkiConnect -> Config`, and verify the settings, especially `webCorsOriginList` should include `"app://obsidian.md"`. The default configuration is usually sufficient:

    ```json
    {
        "apiKey": null,
        "apiLogPath": null,
        "webBindAddress": "127.0.0.1",
        "webBindPort": 8765,
        "webCorsOrigin": "http://localhost",
        "webCorsOriginList": [
            "http://localhost",
            "app://obsidian.md"
        ]
    }
    ```
*   **Duplicate Errors During Sync:** If you encounter errors like `cannot create note because it is a duplicate` even after the ID recovery feature, it might indicate a subtle difference in how Anki checks duplicates versus the plugin's `looselyMatchesFrontField` logic (e.g., HTML normalization differences). Ensure the "Front" field content of the card in Obsidian is truly unique within the target Anki deck.

*   **Missing Deck Key Notice:** If your note has YAML frontmatter but lacks the `cards-deck` key, the plugin will notify you and use the default deck. To specify a deck, add `cards-deck: My Deck Name` to your frontmatter.

*   **Deleted Anki Decks:** If you delete a deck in Anki, cards in your Obsidian notes will be recreated the next time you sync. The plugin will remove the old ID blocks and add new ones automatically.

*   **HTML Comments:** Content inside HTML comments will be ignored for card creation (except for Anki ID comments). This allows you to comment out text without creating unwanted cards.
